### Approach and tradeoffs

##### UI/setup :

I started the project with a standard nextjs template and added some basic UI from shadcn to help things go faster and to have a nice theme ongoing (I chose shadcn because they use next-themes for their themeing which i'm familliar with.). I also chose next-intl as a trans lib, because of it's flexibility on server/client components ‚õ∑Ô∏è.

##### Data fetching :

I just went the basic fetch route for this one, it was mostly fetches so I didn't try complexify things and i wanted to focus more on chartJS. A big tradeoff ü•≤ here was error handling, which I left for last but didn't really got time to implement.

##### ChartJs:

Big focus of the project ü§û
For chart js i used the main library for thr barchart and piecharts with my own custom component, but I did use react-chart2js lib for the line chart for experimentation.
